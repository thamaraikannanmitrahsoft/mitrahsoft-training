Validation rules:

Below things should be done in appropriate situation, while we try to submit the form. Validation messages should be displayed in a DOM element.. 
You shouldn't display the message in an alert..
- If the any one of the text field is empty, you need to display the message "Please enter a number".
- Outbox should be read only type.
- If there is any special characters available in the text field, you need to display the message "Special Character(s) not allowed".
- If there is any letter available in the text field, you need to display the message "letter(s) not allowed".
- Multiple commas and multiple space should be converted into single comma and space. Ex: 1,,,,,,2,,,     3 should be taken as 1,2,3.
- Empty spaces in between commas should be omitted Ex:1, ,2,3 should be considered as 1,2,3.
- Single number is not allowed as input because we need more than one number to manipulate. Ex:1 is not allowed, Input should be in 1,2,3,4 format.
