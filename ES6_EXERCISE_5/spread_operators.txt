Define a function to add numbers. Numbers should be taken from parameters. 
Spread the array as an argument while calling the function and print the result.
Note:Use the console to print the result and display it in terminal.

2) Create an object with the values same as below user object using spread operator and also include the marks: [67, 34, 54,72,56], grade: II.
const user = {
	name: 'karthick',
	age: 12,
    standard: 7
};
Note:Use the console to print the result and display it in terminal.

	age: 26,
	designation: 'software engineer',
	email: 'sr@gmail.com'
};

		name: 'natraj',
        type: ['HB', '2H', 'H'],
        rate: [3, 5, 5],

        type: ['long size', 'king size'],
        rate: [35, 20],
        available_stock: 500
    }
};
 i) merge below array values into the pencilâ€™s rate field:
    [6, 10].
 ii) merge below array into type value of note_book object:
