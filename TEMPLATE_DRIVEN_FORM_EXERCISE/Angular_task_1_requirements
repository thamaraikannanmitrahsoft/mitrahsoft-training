1. Create a new Angular project using compatible versions of Node and TypeScript.
2. Design a form with 8 to 10 fields that include all types of input fields.
3. Utilize only Bootstrap for the design.
4. Implement one-way data binding for the heading and the submit/preview button, which should display "Form submitted" when clicked.
5. Use event binding to create a dropdown that displays an image when a value is selected.
6. Implement property binding for the src attribute of the image.
7. For two-way data binding, when the submit/preview button is clicked, the values entered should be displayed next to the form, and the values should be populated in the input fields for preview.
8. Create an input field for date and currency, and use pipes to display the formatted results.
